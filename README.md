# Design and Development of an IoT Based Medical Device for Management of Dengue Patients by Monitoring Fluid Output

Abstract- According to Sri Lankan health sector sources, there are about 50000 to 100000 dengue virus infections per year. Some hospitals were unable to accommodate the huge volume of patients requiring treatment during the 2017 dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka. Dengue is treated by balancing fluid intake and output. This is done by measuring the fluid output, mainly by measuring the hourly urine output. Currently, this hourly measurement of urine is done manually which demands a considerable amount of their precious time, often overloading them and leading to inaccurate measurements. 

A flow meter is designed by a drop detecting algorithm using a Negative Temperature Coefficient thermistor as the sensing element. Here the voltage signal is converted to digital form and processed by an algorithm that is developed to identify individual drops. The number of drops is then converted to a volume by multiplying by the volume of a drop. The calculated volume flow rate can be observed from the device or the website. This is very much helpful for both patients and the medical staff. That will help to reduce the number of patients entering the hospital as anyone can purchase this device to get treatment at home. Since this is an IOT based device, any medical officer can access any patientâ€™s database containing output urine data and recommend treatments for dengue.
